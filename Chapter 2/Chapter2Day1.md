# Chapter 2 Day 1 Quests Submission 

## 1. What is the difference between frontend and backend? Can you provide a real life example (you can't use the one in this chapter)?

### The frontend is what users see and interact with on the application. An example would be any website you visit on the internet.. everything you see and interact with on the screen is all frontend development. The backend is what is happening in the background of the user interface such as handling the data and all of this is handled by the software developer rather than the user. An example of backend would be large databases online. The data is stored in servers and when user needs data they will click search and the backened will retrieve all the needed data and show it to the user on the frontend.

## 2. What is the difference between global styling and module styling?

### Global styling refers to the styles that will apply to everything on the application. Module styling refers to using a module with styles that will apply only to the files they are imported in so it is more specific and flexible with styling various parts of the application.
